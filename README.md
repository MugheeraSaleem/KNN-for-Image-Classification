# KNN-for-Image-Classification

A KNN Classifier class has been developed to classify images of two different classes "Ducks" and "Horses". The data for training has been collected from the 
internet namely of the before mentioned classes.!0 images for each class have been collected for this exercise but it can work for as many images as
you like(while keeping in regard the memory available to you). These images are then fed into the Classifier. After this 10 images have been used as
test data for the classifier, 5 of each class. This classifier after being trained on the provided dataset and on the test data is giving 70% accuracy 
which is quite imressive for such a simple classifier.
